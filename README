Places to change numbers if board slots change:
configure.sh youâ€™ve the lines at the bottom, change slots and one address code
connect.sh, change address codes
run.sh, the same
stop.sh, the same
launch.sh, change SSB slot number

the launch.sh can be your main script to launch
you can use it without any arguments, like so: ./launch.sh
and it will load all constants, start running, and show you the status output that will refresh - you can quit that with Ctrl+C
then you stop the run using ./stop.sh
now, as constant loading takes some time, you can also run ./launch.sh fast
that will circumvent the constants loading

you also have monitor_running in which you need to change the SSB slot
